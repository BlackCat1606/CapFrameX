## Animated frame time test

What am I gonna do here is to provide a visualization of frame times. This could let the user see and feel how smooth the records are. Will be pretty cool I hope. 

Features:
* Push various synthetic sequences
* Push real-world data (data from OCAT)
* Watch parallel live chart
* Watching smoothness/stuttering and aliasing effects at high-contrast transitions due to low FPS
