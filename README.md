* Application architecture based on MVVM pattern und DI (work in progess)
* UI design (work in progess)
* Advanced statistical methods and algorithm validation
* OCAT interface
* Database management
* WIX installer
* First beta phase
* Next steps?

## Animated frame time test

What am I gonna do here is to provide a visualization of frame times. This could let the user see and feel how smooth the records are. Will be pretty cool I hope. 

Features:
* Push various synthetic sequences
* Push real-world data (data from OCAT)
* Watch simultaneous live chart
* Watching smoothness/stuttering and aliasing effects at high-contrast transitions due to low FPS
* 2D/3D animation
* 3D animation using adaptive sync
